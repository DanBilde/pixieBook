Rob-E looks up and sees a fairy. She asks "What's the matter, little robot?"Rob-E answers "I built a robot so that he can be my friend. I did not have any friends because the other were mean to me. But he turned evil and I do not know what to do. He is too strong for me to stop.""I'll help you. But there's one condition" says the fairy."Yes, what is it? " asks Rob-E."You have to forgive the other robots that did not play with you." answers the fairy."But they were mean . I don't want to" pouts Rob-E."Big Ben hurt them , right? And it is your fault. Can you really not forgive them? "Rob-E thinks of what the fairy said and agrees."I'll forgive them".</p>
